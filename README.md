# Utility Construction Website Summary

### For the final project of my Tech Academy course I was assigned to a Live Project, composed of a 2 week sprint with daily standups and summaries, centered around the tasks and designs asked for by a construction company client.

#### Over the course of two weeks I was asked to design multiple webpages and logos for a construction website, a story for each design. The Live Project asked for me to complete 4 stories for the duration of the sprint, I ended up doing 8. So, to not overwhelm, I will upload snippit images of the projects to this summary, as it will still succeed in showing off the design.

## Logo/Landing page

##### The initial assigned stories were to create a new logo and landing page for the website. The logo was to be a simple, modern logo that encorporates an idea of corporate construction rather than homes (as seen above). I ended up making two different logos, one more along the lines of the simple and modern instruction, and one that was a bit more creative. I ended up using the modern one as the main logo and used the other in the footer.

##### The Landing Page was formatted for web, tablet, and mobile, with the webpage format displayed below.

## Home Page

##### I was asked to make a homepage with a navbar and multiple sections to the page. To go along with the modern feel of the page I designed it with the idea it would have a "snap-to" design, where each section would be the anchorpoint the browser jumps to when scrolled down, so each page is always displayed in full until the user decides to scroll on.

I displayed the hover effect of the navbar on the Projects button in the picture below, which would also have "constructions" and "architecture" subsections to click to within it.

## Construction Page

##### The Construction page I had included when designing the homepage was a section. However, this design was for a full webpage. I figured since this would be a page actively clicked into from the homepage, it could drop the sleeker "snap-to" design and just be a smooth scrolling page. Both the homepage and Construction page include a CTA to send a message, displayed below.

The Construction page contains, along with a "Featured Project", multiple completed projects, which reformat from containing two projects on one row to one project on one row, depending on screen size.
