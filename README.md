# Utility Construction Website Summary

### For the final project of my Tech Academy course I was assigned to a Live Project, composed of a 2 week sprint with daily standups and summaries, centered around the tasks and designs asked for by a construction company client.

#### Over the course of two weeks I was asked to design multiple webpages and logos for a construction website, a story for each design. Each design created was formatted into web, tablet, and mobile sizes. The Live Project asked for me to complete 4 stories for the duration of the sprint, I ended up doing 8. So, to not overwhelm, I will upload snippit images of the projects to this summary, as it will still succeed in showing off the design.

## Logo/Landing page

##### The initial assigned stories were to create a new logo and landing page for the website. The logo was to be a simple, modern logo that encorporates an idea of corporate construction rather than homes (as seen above). I ended up making two different logos, one more along the lines of the simple and modern instruction, and one that was a bit more creative. I ended up using the modern one as the main logo and used the other in the footer.

##### The webpage sized landing page is displayed below.

## Home Page

##### I was asked to make a homepage with a navbar and multiple sections to the page. To go along with the modern feel of the page I designed it with the idea it would have a "snap-to" design, where that beginning of each section would be the anchorpoint the browser jumps to when scrolled down, so that each section is always displayed in full until the user decides to scroll on to the next.

I displayed the hover effect of the navbar on the Projects button in the picture below, which would also have "constructions" and "architecture" subsections to click to within it.

## Construction Page

##### The Construction page I had included when designing the homepage was a section. However, this design was for a full webpage. The page was asked for by the client to be an area to see current and previous projects along with descriptions and a mission statement at the top. I figured since this would be a page actively clicked into from the homepage, it could drop the sleeker "snap-to" design and just be a smooth scrolling page. Both the homepage and Construction page include a CTA to send a message, displayed below.

The Construction page contains, along with a "Featured Project", multiple completed projects, which reformat from containing two projects on one row to one project on one row, depending on screen size.
