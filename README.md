# Utility Construction Website Summary

### For the final project of my Tech Academy course I was assigned to a Live Project assignment, composed of a 2 week sprint, centered around the tasks and designs asked for by a construction company.

##### Over the course of two weeks I was asked to design multiple webpages and logos for a construction website, consisting of a story for each design. The Live Project asked for me to complete 4 stories for the duration of the sprint, I ended up doing 8. So, to not overwhelm, I will upload snippit images of the projects to this summary, as it will still succeed in showing off the design.

## Logo/Headpage

##### The initial assigned stories were to create a new logo and landing page for the website. The logo was to be a simple, modern logo that encorporates an idea of corporate construction rather than homes. I ended up making two different logos, one more along the lines to the simple and modern instruction and one that was a bit more creative. I ended up using the modern one as the main logo and used the other in the footer.

##### The Headpage was formatted for web, tablet, and mobile, with the webpage format displayed below.

## Home Page

##### The homepage I created without knowledge of what future pages I would be asked to design in the future story. I was asked to make a homepage with a navbar and multiple sections to the page. To go along with the modern feel of the page I designed it with the idea it would have a "snap-to" design, where each section would be the anchorpoint the browser jumps to when scrolled down, so each page is always displayed in full until the user decides to scroll on. I displayed the hover effect of the navbar buttons on the projects button, which would also have "constructions" and "architecture" subsections to click to within the projects section. 

## Construction Page

##### The Construction page I had included when designing the homepage was a section, however this design was for a full webpage. I figured since this would be a page actively clicked into, it could drop the sleeker "snap-to" design and just be a smooth scrolling page. Both the homepage and Construction page include a CTA to send a message, displayed below. The Construction page contains, along with a "Featured Project", multiple completed projects, which reformat from containing two projects on one row to one project on one row, depending on screen size.
